			<h3>About IPM</h3>
			<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) uses a combination of biological, cultural and chemical tools to enable beneficial insects and mites to keep pest populations below damaging levels and enhance the production of high-quality marketable produce.
				Beneficial insects are nearly always already present but usually need help for us to see the benefits. The most important help we can give them is to use pesticides only when monitoring indicates they are necessary and then only use those selective for the target pest.
				IPM programs tend to use less sprays because pesticides are used only where other approaches have not held the pest to acceptable levels. Resistance to most pesticides exists as a result of normal genetic variation in all insect populations and means that there are almost always some survivors left to re-establish an infestation. Therefore, pesticides should be specifically chosen to leave beneficial insects alive to prey on remaining pests and prevent further outbreaks.	
				By reducing dependence on pesticides, IPM is an essential ingredient to developing a sustainable future for agriculture.

			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>Anthony gained a PhD from the School of Agricultural Science, University of Tasmania in 2005 where he specialised in the reproductive ecology of parasitoids in collaboration with CSIRO and the CRC for sustainable Production Forestry. In 2005, he took up a position in the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy as Senior Entomologist where for nearly 10 years he delivered domestic and international surveillance for insect pests of National agricultural significance and held oversight of the Torres Strait Fruit Fly Monitoring network.

				We started our own IPM consultancy in 2015 and have now moved to Stanthorpe in the Granite Belt to continue working in horticulture. We are currently servicing growers in South East Queensland and Northern New South Wales.
				
				“My background in insect ecology enables me to bring a different perspective to pest management. Being able to apply what I’ve learnt over years in a very practical way, to improve on-farm pest management and maximise marketable produce gives great personal satisfaction.”</p>
